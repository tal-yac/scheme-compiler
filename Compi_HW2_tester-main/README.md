# Compilation Course - Assignment 2 - Tester
This is a collaboratory tester for assignment 2, meaning the test collection is a collective effort of all the students. 

# How to run the tester
1. Pull the `tester.ml`, `tp_tests.ml`, `sa_tests.ml` files and place them together with the project files in the same directory
2. run `ocaml tester.ml`

*IMPROTANT!*
The tester assumes the Tag_Parser and Semantic_Analysis modules are written in a file named `compiler.ml`

# How to add tests of your own
1. Open `tp_tests.ml` file if you want to add tests for the Tag_Parser 
or `sa_tests.ml` if you want to add tests for the Semantic_Analysis
2. Edit the file
3. Add wanted tests
4. Commit the changes and create a pull request
